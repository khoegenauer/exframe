The reaction was terminated by adding 5 mM EDTA in 10 mM Tris, pH7.6, and samples were dialyzed in chromatin RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Na deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) before overnight IP at 4C with H3K4Me2 (Millipore 07-030) antibodies. Libraries were constructed using 10 ng each of ChIP and input DNA from up to 3 pooled experiments were processed for deep sequencing according to manufacturer's instructions (Illumina). Prior to sequencing, qPCR was used to verify that positive and negative control ChIP regions amplified in the linear range.

12947	12951	569			digestion with MspI		40-120 and 120-220	bp	genomic	bisulfite-seq	reduced		Genomic DNA was isolated from the myeloid cell lines HL-60. DNA was digested with MspI (NEB), a methylation-insensitive enzyme that cuts C'CGG. Digested DNA was size selected on a 4% NuSieve 3:1 Agarose gel (Lonza). For each sample, two slices containing DNA fragments of 40-120 bp and 120-220 bp, respectively, were excised from the unstained preparative portion of the gel. These two size fractions were kept apart throughout the procedure including the final sequencing. Pre-annealed Illumina adaptors containing 5'-methyl-cytosine instead of cytosine were ligated to size-selected MspI fragments. Adapter-ligated fragments were bisulfite-treated using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). The products were PCR amplified, size selected, and sequenced on the Illumina GA IIx at a reading length of 36 bp.	
12952	12955	569	569						genomic	chip-seq	chip		Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the DNA Sample Kit (Part# 0801-0303). Briefly, DNA was end-repaired using a combination of T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow fragment (32 to 52 exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for ligation of Illumina's adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the 3‚Äô end. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers for 15 cycles and library fragments of ~250 bp (insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences) were band isolated from an agarose gel. The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on the Genome Analyzer following the manufacturer's protocols.
