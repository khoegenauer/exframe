9684	12723	566	588	Translated RNA was isolated using GFP-TRAP(Green Fluorescent Protein-Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification). GFP-TRAP uses transgenic mice that express an Enhanced Green Fluorescent protein fused to the N-terminus of the large subunit ribosomal protein L10a (EGFP-L10a) in targeted cell populations.  This allows immunoaffinity purification of ribosome-bound mRNA specific to the selected cell types.  For more information, see Heiman M., Schaefer A., Gong S., Peterson J. D., Day M., Ramsey K. E., Suarez-Farinas M., Schwarz C., Stephan D. A., Surmeier D. J., Greengard P., Heintz N. (2008). A translational profiling approach for the molecular characterization of CNS cell types.

12974	12983	565	588	Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. RNA quantity was assessed using Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and RNA integrity was analyzed using Nano chip for Eukaryotes on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A RIN of 8.0 and above was considered to indicate a satisfactory sample quality.	For each sample, 200 ng of total RNA in a volume of 5 µl was amplified using the Applause WT Amp ST, RNA Amplification System (NuGen, San Carlos, CA) and labeled with Encore Biotin Module, Post Amplification System (NuGen).	A total of 2.5 µg of labeled cDNA, along with GeneChip Hybridization Control reagents (Affymetrix), was injected into an Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array. The chips were incubated for 18 hours at 45C and rotated at 60 RPM to allow hybridization. The chips were then washed and stained using GeneChip Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) using the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450. Stained arrays were scanned on Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.
