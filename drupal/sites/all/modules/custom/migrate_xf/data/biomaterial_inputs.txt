7068	7074		We expressed an MLL-AF9 (official gene symbols: Mll1 & Mllt3) fusion protein in highly purified interleukin (IL)-7R-Lin-Sca-1-c-Kit+CD34+FcgammaRII/IIIhi granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMP) and injected them into sublethally irradiated syngeneic recipient mice. Within 80 days, animals transplanted with murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-MLL-AF9 transduced GMP developed an oligoclonal acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), similar to other MLL fusion leukaemia models. Retroviral or knock-in models of MLL-fusion-induced leukaemias demonstrate the presence of IL-7R-Lin-Sca-1-c-Kit+CD34+FcgammaRII/III+ GMP-like leukaemic cells (L-GMP). We isolated L-GMP from mice that were approximately 60 days post transplant and had clinically evident leukaemia.  (Ex vivo growth of these cells in cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose revealed that L-GMP possessed higher blast colony-forming activity than other populations. Transplantation of purified L-GMP into sublethally irradiated recipients was used to assess leukaemogenesis in vivo. Each of the mice transplanted with 20 to 5 times 103 L-GMP developed AML that was phenotypically identical to the primary disease.)
